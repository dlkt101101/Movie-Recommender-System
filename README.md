# Movie-Recommender-System
As an avid movie enthusiast, I've always been intrigued by the personalized recommendations offered by streaming platforms like Netflix. Curious about the underlying algorithms and techniques used to suggest movies, I embarked on a personal project to learn about recommender systems and eventually build my own. To achieve this, I explored and implemented matrix factorization and the KNN algorithm for both user-based and item-based recommendations, providing a comprehensive approach to suggesting tailored movie choices.
